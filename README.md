## Introduction
Fraud detection in financial transactions has become a critical area of concern due to the escalating complexity and sophistication of fraudulent activities. In this project, I delve into the exploration of machine learning techniques to combat fraud in financial transactions. By leveraging a synthetic dataset encompassing 6,362,620 transactions, I analyze the performance of various machine learning classifiers using transaction-level features. Specifically, I used Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forests classifiers to identify the most effective approach. I assess the performance of each classifier and compare their results, focusing on accuracy as the primary evaluation metric. The findings indicate that Random Forest Classifier surmounts the other classifiers with an accuracy rate of 99% and recall of 100%, by leveraging a combination of ensemble learning and decision trees, the Random Forest Classifier showcased superior predictive capabilities and robustness, outperforming the other classifiers examined in this study. Its ability to effectively capture complex relationships and identify subtle patterns within the transaction-level features contributed to its outstanding performance, demonstrating its superior predictive capabilities for fraud detection in financial transactions.
## Dataset Description
The dataset utilized in this project was sourced from the "Synthetic Financial Datasets for Fraud Detection" repository available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1). This repository specifically focuses on providing synthetic financial data for fraud detection research. It should be noted that the dataset used in this study represents a subset of the original dataset, consisting of approximately 6,362,620 samples. 
Within this dataset, there were a total of 8213 fraud transactions and 6,354,407 legitimate ones. This distribution enabled the study to capture a wide range of transactional scenarios, including both fraudulent and legitimate activities. By analyzing this dataset, I aimed to gain insights into the performance of various machine learning classifiers in effectively detecting instances of fraud within financial transactions.
## Analysis of the data
As part of my project, I conducted a comprehensive examination of the dataset to uncover any underlying patterns and potential correlations among its features. The main objective of this analysis was to identify noteworthy features or information that could aid in effectively distinguishing fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. To begin the analysis, I loaded the complete dataset and utilized the Matplotlib library to create a heatmap showcasing the correlation matrix. This visual representation allowed for a clearer understanding of the interrelationships between different features.

In this analysis, I focused on selecting features with correlation values greater than 0.4 to generate the heatmap. After plotting the correlation matrix in the form of a heatmap, I observed that certain features displayed significant correlations. These included oldbalanceOrg, newbalanceOrg, oldbalanceDest, and newbalanceDest. It is worth noting that these correlations were apart from the diagonal entries, which represent the correlation of a feature with itself. To gain a better understanding of the feature distributions, I proceeded to create a scatter density plot for further analysis.
